# horiseon-accessibility-refactor

## Description

I was tasked with refactoring existing code for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.
New software has made the internet more accessible to all users by using braille keyboards, screen readers, etc.  I have made changes to the code to make the web application more compatible with these softwares. I did this by changing the formatting of the HTML to follow a semantic structure and adding alt image tags to provide a description of the images that are displayed.
