# horiseon-accessibility-refactor

## Description

I was tasked with refactoring existing code for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.
New software has mad the internet more accessible to all users by using braille keyboards, screen readers, etc.  I have made changes to the code to make it semantic so it will be compatible with these softwares.
